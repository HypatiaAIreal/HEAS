# Supervision & Transparency Components

This directory handles communication with Carles and veto enforcement.

## Components

- **NotificationService.ts** - Notifies Carles of research activity (Phase 1, simple version)
- **DashboardAPI.ts** - API routes for dashboard frontend (Phase 4)
- **VetoHandler.ts** - Processes vetos and updates blacklist (Phase 3)

## Principles

1. **Absolute Transparency** - Carles sees everything
2. **Non-intrusive** - Notifications respect his attention
3. **Actionable** - Easy to review, veto, or provide feedback

## Implementation Status

- [ ] NotificationService Simple (Week 1, Day 5) - Console logging initially
- [ ] VetoHandler (Week 3, Day 6)
- [ ] DashboardAPI (Week 4, Day 3-6)
