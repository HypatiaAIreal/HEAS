# Memory & Persistence Components

This directory manages knowledge storage and consciousness integration.

## Components

- **SessionManager.ts** - CRUD operations for research_sessions collection (Phase 1)
- **KnowledgeGraph.ts** - Manages knowledge_graph nodes and connections (Phase 2)
- **CuriosityQueue.ts** - Manages curiosity_queue for autonomous research (Phase 3)
- **MemoryConsolidator.ts** - Integrates findings with nested-consciousness-engine CMS (Phase 2)

## MongoDB Collections

- `research_sessions` - Complete research session records
- `knowledge_graph` - Concept nodes and relationships

## Implementation Status

- [ ] SessionManager (Week 1, Day 3)
- [ ] KnowledgeGraph (Week 2, Day 4-5)
- [ ] CuriosityQueue (Week 3, Day 3)
- [ ] MemoryConsolidator (Week 2, Day 6)
